[20241001 11:10:37.129] - Expecting imbalanced, but observe balanced traffic. Please check config.
=> TC5 encountered the following failures:
[TestCase Description] - MTP INFO | JTMS LINK : https://systest.juniper.net/feature_testplan/79342 | Test Case No : 5.2-3, 5.2-5 | TEST DESCRIPTION | Delete and re-apply conditional match on flex hash rule | Procedure/Steps: | 1. Configure flex hash conditional match for IPv4 TCP traffic | 2. Transmit MPLS/IPv6 traffic by varying UDP src/dst ports | 3. Observed imbalanced traffic due to mismatched flex conditional match | 4. Delete conditional match for TCP, and apply the one for UDP | 5. Verify traffic is still load balanced across all egress links | 6. Stop traffic and verify no traffic loss
